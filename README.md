# Netflix-Movie-Recommendation-System

This file uses various Machine learning algorithms to find recommendations. The dataset used for the project was Netflix Prize dataset which is available at the Kaggle website. The different Algorithms used are:
1) Content Based:
    Mean Rating,
    Weighted Mean Rating
2) Collaborative Filtering Based:
    User-User/ Item-Item Similarity,
    Matrix Factorisation using gradient descent,
    Matrix Factorisation using Single value decomposition,
    Matrix Factorisation using Deep Learning Model
    
At the end all the methods were compared to find the most efficient method and the results were compared with results from different contributors from kaggle.
